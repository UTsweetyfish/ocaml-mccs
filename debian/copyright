 As a special exception to the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may link,
 statically or dynamically, a "work that uses the library" with a publicly
 distributed version of the library to produce an executable file containing
 portions of the library, and distribute that executable file under terms of
 your choice, without any of the additional requirements listed in clause 6 of
 the GNU Lesser General Public License. By "a publicly distributed version of
 the library", we mean either the unmodified library as distributed by OCamlPro,
 or a modified version of the library that is distributed under the conditions
 defined in clause 2 of the GNU Lesser General Public License. This exception
 does not however invalidate any other reasons why the executable file might be
 covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License.
